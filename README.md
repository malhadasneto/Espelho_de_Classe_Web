Welcome to "Espelho de Classe"!

This is a small project created to help teachers to organize their classrooms. My sister told me that every term she faces the same problem: students that must be in the front of the classroom (due to special conditions as vision or ADHD); students that want to be close to their best friends; the opposite, students that can't sit close to others; also there are some very tall students that must be placed in the back of the classroom.

So this small program was designed to help her. Maybe it can help others too. 

Please tell me if you like (or if it stop working for any reason!)
